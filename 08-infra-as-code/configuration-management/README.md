# Configuration-management

## What is it ?

Configuration management is a fundamental practice in the administration of IT systems and infrastructures. This practice encompasses all the processes and tools used to define, set up, monitor and maintain the configuration of a computer system, whether it is servers, workstations, networks or even software.

Configuration management therefore consists of maintaining an accurate and up-to-date record of all elements of an IT infrastructure, as well as the relationships and dependencies between them. This includes servers, databases, software, configuration settings, data files, SSL certificates, IP addresses, etc. Each item is documented, tracked and, where possible, automated.

Part of the Infra-As-Code tools class, configuration management tools use computer code that can be saved in version control managers.

## Benefits of Configuration Management

Configuration management offers many benefits, including:    

- Consistency: By ensuring that configurations are consistent across the entire infrastructure, it minimizes the risk of errors and security breaches.

- Automation: Repetitive and time-consuming configuration management tasks can be automated, freeing up time for IT teams. This also limits incidents due to human errors.

- Responsive: Configuration management enables rapid response to changing needs by adjusting configurations effectively.

- Traceability: Thanks to its storage in code version managers, it provides a history of changes made to configurations, which is essential for problem solving.

- Security: Ensures that devices are configured according to good security practices, thereby reducing vulnerabilities.

## Some configuration management tools

Tools such as Ansible, Chef, Rudder, Salt and Puppet are designed to facilitate this successful execution of this complex task by allowing IT teams to define, monitor and maintain the configuration in a consistent and automated manner. These tools provide significant benefits, including cost savings, increased security and improved operational efficiency.
